## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type definitions
- Avoid `any` types when possible

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing component structure
- Include proper prop types and documentation

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the existing design system patterns
- Ensure responsive design

### File Organization
```
client/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/           # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...           # Feature-specific components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/            # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/              # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ pages/            # Page components
```

## Component Guidelines

### Creating New Components

1. **Location**: Place reusable components in `client/src/components/ui/`
2. **Naming**: Use PascalCase for component names
3. **Structure**:
   ```tsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

   interface ComponentProps {
     // Define props with proper types
   }

   export const Component = ({ ...props }: ComponentProps) => {
     return (
       // Component JSX
     );
   };
   ```

### Documentation
- Include JSDoc comments for complex components
- Provide usage examples in comments
- Document prop interfaces thoroughly

## Scientific Visualization Guidelines

When adding scientific visualization components:

1. **Accuracy**: Ensure scientific accuracy in visualizations
2. **Performance**: Optimize for large datasets
3. **Accessibility**: Include proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
4. **Responsiveness**: Ensure components work on all screen sizes

## Testing

- Write tests for new components and utilities
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting PR
- Test across different browsers and devices

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title Format
Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring

- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### PR Description
Include:
- **What**: Brief description of changes
- **Why**: Reason for the changes
- **How**: Technical approach used
- **Testing**: How the changes were tested
