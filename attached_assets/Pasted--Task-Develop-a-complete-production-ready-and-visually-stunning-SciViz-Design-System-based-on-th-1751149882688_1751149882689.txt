"Task: Develop a complete, production-ready, and visually stunning SciViz Design System based on the provided GitHub repository.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/rajshah9305/SciViz-Design-System

Objectives:
Code & UI Completion:
    * Thoroughly complete all missing or incomplete code and UI components, leaving no placeholders or TODOs.
    * Ensure all code is error-free, robust, and production-ready.

Visual Design & UX:
    * Design a visually stunning, modern, and professional user interface.
    * Integrate subtle yet sophisticated animations and interactions to enhance user experience.
    * The UI should feel trendy, innovative, and ready for real-world application, while maintaining a scientific and elegant aesthetic.

Full-Stack Functionality & Deployment:
    * Implement complete full-stack functionality, including frontend and backend components as necessary for a fully functional design system.
    * Provide all necessary deployment configurations for seamless deployment.

GitHub Repository Structure & Documentation:
    * Organize the project with a clear and standard GitHub repository structure (e.g., /components, /pages, /styles, /utils, /hooks, /public, etc.).
    * Create a comprehensive and well-written README.md file, including:
        * Project description and purpose.
        * Detailed setup instructions.
        * Explanation of any environment variables (.env.example if applicable).
        * A clear deployment guide.
    * Include a production-ready vercel.json configuration file for instant and seamless Vercel deployment.

Advanced Feature Implementation:
    * Implement fully responsive layouts across all devices.
    * Integrate a modern and user-friendly dark/light mode toggle.
    * Incorporate sophisticated animations using libraries like GSAP, Framer Motion, or Three.js (for more complex visual elements, if appropriate for the design system's components).
    * Enable robust theme customization capabilities using Tailwind CSS.
    * Ensure all code adheres to best practices for performance, accessibility, and maintainability.

Ease of Use:
    * The project must be immediately runnable and deployable after cloning from GitHub, requiring minimal setup.

Technical Requirements:
* Language: TypeScript preferred for all new and modified code.
* Code Quality: Clean, modular, reusable, and well-commented codebase.

Project Scope: This is a personal project for personal use, therefore no licensing restrictions are required within the code or documentation.

Deliverables:
* A complete, error-free, and production-ready GitHub repository.
* All features specified above fully implemented and working correctly.
* A unique, professional, and elegantly designed UI/UX.
* Full out-of-the-box support for Vercel deployment."
